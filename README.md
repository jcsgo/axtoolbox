# axtoolbox
This is a toolbox specific for analytics usage in python. Several functions are written here to save some time. Specifically:

### Avoiding hardcoding passwords --> refer to `keys.py`
Instead of hardcoding username and passwords, you can now obscure them in your code. Username and password details will be encrypted and can be recalled using functions within keys.py.

### Installing and updating `axtoolbox`
To install, run:
```
pip install git+git://github.com/jcsgo/axtoolbox.git
```
To update, run:
```
pip install --upgrade git+git://github.com/jcsgo/axtoolbox.git
```
